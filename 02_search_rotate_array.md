In this problem, the main target is to find the index for the minimum value, because is required to select the range in the future search. This search uses the same binary search, and the finding condition compares with the next and previous value in the array position. After the index is found, we use the binary search recursive using the range from the index to the end of the array if the value is less than the element in the position zero, or from the position zero to the index, if the value is higher than the element in position zero.

The function ```search_pivot``` finds the index for the minimum value in the rotated array and the time complexity is ```O(log(n))```, which ```n``` is the length of the array. The function ```rotated_array_search``` also uses binary search and the time complexity is too ```O(log(n))```. The space complexity for both functions is ```O(1)``` because it not changes.
