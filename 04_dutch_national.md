For the Input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, the program sorts the array in a single traversal, if the element is 0, put it on the left, if the element is 2, put it at the end, and skip if element is 1.

The time complexity is O(n), which n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1).
